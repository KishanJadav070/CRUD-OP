# CRUD-OP
CRUD Operation API Testing

This project demonstrates the implementation and testing of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a RESTful API. The goal is to test and validate API functionality using tools like Postman to ensure seamless data handling and proper HTTP status codes for each operation.

## About the Project
This project is a simple demonstration of CRUD operations performed on a database using a RESTful API. It simulates operations like adding a new resource, fetching resources, updating a resource, and deleting a resource. The API supports JSON responses and proper error handling for invalid requests.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js** - Backend runtime
- **Express.js** - Framework for building APIs
- **MongoDB** or **MySQL** - Database for data storage
- **Postman** - API testing
- **npm** - Dependency manager

---

## Features
- Add new data (**Create**)
- Retrieve existing data (**Read**)
- Update specific data (**Update**)
- Remove unwanted data (**Delete**)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Easy testing via Postman

---

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/crud-operation-api.git
   b.com/username/crud-operation-api.git

  2.Navigate to the project directory:

```bash

cd crud-operation-api
```
2.Install dependencies:

```bash

npm install
Configure environment variables in a .env file:
```
```bash

PORT=9000
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```
3.Start the server:

```bash

npm start
```
Usage

Use the following base URL to access the API:

```text
http://localhost:9000
```
Example JSON Body for API requests:

```json
http://localhost:9000/ALLproduct
```

## Output
```
{
  "product_name": "cap1",
  "quantity": "1",
  "cost": "50",
  "size": "small",
  "id": 1
}

```
